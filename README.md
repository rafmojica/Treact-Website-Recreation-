oh geez oh god i'm going to code this website completely on my own based on what i learned in the past two weeks oh god.

i hope it doesn't look too bad...

UPDATE!!!
I am confident to push my changes to GitHub. The site looks good but it still has many bugs for mobile integration. It only looks good on iPhone XR+, but looks absolutely horrible on iPads and Galaxy Folds or whatever. 90% of the buttons on the site DO NOT function, so don't expect some things to work when pressed.
